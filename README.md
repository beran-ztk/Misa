# MISA

MISA is a personal meta-organization and orchestration system.  
It is designed to model, connect, and control all workflows in a structured and explicit way.

## Concept & Direction
MISA treats work and knowledge as **Items** with clearly defined lifecycles, dependencies, and state transitions that can be orchestrated.
It includes a deeply integrated calendar used for orchestration rather than scheduling.  
Its long-term goal is to manage a Zettelkasten-like knowledge system where topics, work units, and decisions can be critically evaluated over time.
